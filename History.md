Enhancement:

 - Add `toBlob` for quickly fetching a sequence of opaque bytes.

## v0.2.0 [2025-04-01] Mahlon E. Smith <mahlon@martini.nu>

Well that didn't take long!  Update for Kuzu 0.9.0.

No practical changes, but there was a prepared statements
binding bugfix in the underlying lib that was biting us,
so update version to reflect the 0.9.0 release.
